## PLC-Based Bottle Cap Sorting System

This project simulates a PLC-controlled system that sorts orange-colored metallic bottle caps using a conveyor, sensors, and actuators.

### Tools Used
- Siemens STEP 7 (for ladder logic programming)
- FluidSIM (for pneumatic and sensor simulation)

### Files Included
- `LadderLogic.ct` – STEP 7 ladder logic program
- `FluidSIM_Simulation.flsim` – Simulation setup
